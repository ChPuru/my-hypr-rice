## âœ¨ Features

* **Dynamic Theming Engine**: Switch between curated themes instantly or generate a new theme from any wallpaper using `pywal`. All components, from the terminal to the lock screen, are themed automatically.

* **Stunning Visuals**: A beautiful and functional AGS setup featuring an advanced dashboard, a slide-out control center, interactive on-screen-displays (OSDs) for volume/brightness, and a personalized lock screen.

* **Intelligent Installer**: An interactive installer that detects your hardware (like NVIDIA GPUs), asks about your setup (Laptop/Desktop), and configures the system accordingly.

* **TUI Rice Manager**: A user-friendly terminal menu (`rice-manager.sh`) to control your entire setupâ€”switch themes, update the rice from GitHub, and verify the installation.

* **Productivity Focused**: Comes with a pre-configured Neovim setup using `lazy.nvim`, a themed tmux environment, and integrated `lazygit` for a seamless development workflow.

* **Gaming Ready**: Includes configurations for Steam, Lutris, MangoHud, and GameMode for an optimized gaming experience, right out of the box.

* **Unified Shell Experience**: All components, from the bar to the control center, are designed to work together as a single, cohesive unit.
