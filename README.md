# My Hypr-Rice: A Curated Manual Build for Hyprland

![Showcase](docs/showcase.png)

A complete, meticulously themed, and highly functional Hyprland setup built entirely by hand. After frustrating experiences with complex automation, this repository represents a return to first principles: a stable, understandable, and beautiful desktop where every component is placed with purpose.

This is not a framework with scripts; it is a **blueprint**. It provides the exact, verified configuration files needed to build a state-of-the-art desktop from a clean Arch Linux installation.
